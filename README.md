# ðŸŽ§ Planar Magnetic Headphones with Halbach Arrays

A final-year engineering project investigating **planar magnetic drivers** using **Halbach magnet arrays** as a viable, lightweight alternative to traditional headphone designs. This system combines **high-fidelity audio** with **portability**, achieving low distortion, linear impedance, and impressive voltage responseâ€”outperforming commercial models like the Sony WH-1000XM3 in technical tests.

## ðŸ”¬ Highlights

* Flexible Kapton PCB with serpentine copper traces
* Dual Halbach arrays for focused magnetic flux and reduced weight
* 3D-printed driver enclosure and open-back earcup design
* Voltage and impedance stability across the audible range (20 Hz â€“ 20 kHz)
* 88% reduction in impedance variation vs. commercial benchmark

## ðŸ“Š Results

* <0.6 â„¦ impedance variation
* 472g total weight (lighter than many planar headphones)
* Clear, high-resolution sound with minimal EQ required

## ðŸš€ Future Work

* Improve high-frequency response
* Integrate wireless (Bluetooth) functionality
* Optimize diaphragm material for further weight reduction
